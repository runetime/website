If you're writing code in your post and you want it to look nice, put 4 spaces before each line of code:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>
          This is my code.
        </p>
      </body>
    </html>

Alternatively you can place your code in a fenced code block to avoid putting 4 spaces before each line:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This is my code.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you have one line of code you want in a paragraph of text, you can use tick marks `to make inline code`.  This gives the code a `nice background` while also staying in your paragraph.
