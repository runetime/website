# RuneTime Website

Source code for the [RuneTime website](http://runetime.com).  This project is currently closed-source but will be open-source in the future.


## Contributing

[RuneTime](http://runetime.com) uses many tools for fast code completion, automation, and equivilant local environments.  The following are a list of required tools and are elaborated on below with instructions to getting started:

- [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

The development team at [RuneTime](http://runetime.com) uses the IDE [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) as well as the text editors [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [Brackets.io](http://brackets.io/), and [Atom.io](http://atom.io).


## Setting Up

To get setup for development, you need to get the following installed:


### Installations
To get ready for developing for RuneTime, you need to setup two programs:
- [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)


##### Installing VirtualBox
[VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) is a program published by [Oracle](http://oracle.com).  VirtualBox allows you to, essentially, have one or more Operating Systems run in your Operating System.  Each of these Operating Systems that runs is called a "box".  You can run Linux, Mac, Windows, etc.  Many servers run Ubuntu, which is what RuneTime will run on.  VirtualBox is needed so that it has the same services and versions installed as the actual website.

To install VirtualBox, perform the following steps:
1. Download the installer for your Operating System at their [downloads page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Install the program.

Vwala, you're done with VirtualBox!


##### Installing Vagrant
[Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) is a wrapper around VirtualBox to simplify setting it up.  It allows you to preconfigure settings for your boxes, such as the Operating System version, what should be installed, what versions, what modules, etc.

To install Vagrant, perform the following steps:
1. Download the installer for your Operating System at their [downloads page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
2. Install the program.
3. Restart your computer.
